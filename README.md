A computer generated random value is never random. We're just unaware of the variable that's been used to compute the so called, "random" value.

So, now that we know this. Dawg is a platform where you can create plugins that takes in, any n nunber of variable api endpoints, and computes a random certainty value (on the 100% scale) and returns a result. 

Quite useless, huh?
